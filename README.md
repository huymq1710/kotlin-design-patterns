# 🎨 Design Patterns Implemented in Kotlin

![kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/images/kotlin-logo.png)

This repository contains implementations of classic design patterns in Kotlin, showcasing modern and idiomatic approaches to these time-tested software engineering solutions.

## 📚 Pattern Catalogs

The repository is organized into three main categories:

### 1️⃣ Creational Patterns 🏗️

These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms that enhance flexibility and promote code reuse by controlling the object creation process.

- 🏭 **Factory Method**: Creates objects without specifying the exact class to create
- 🧪 **Abstract Factory**: Creates families of related objects
- 🧱 **Builder**: Constructs complex objects step by step
- 🧬 **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying existing ones
- 🔒 **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance

### 2️⃣ Structural Patterns 🧩

These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping them flexible and efficient.

- 🔌 **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together
- 🌉 **Bridge**: Separates abstraction from implementation
- 🌲 **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures
- 🧤 **Decorator**: Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically
- 🏛️ **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem
- 🪶 **Flyweight**: Minimizes memory usage by sharing common parts of state
- 🕵️ **Proxy**: Provides a surrogate for another object

### 3️⃣ Behavioral Patterns 🧠

These patterns focus on communication between objects, how they operate together, and the delegation of responsibilities.

- 🔗 **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes requests along a chain of handlers
- 📦 **Command**: Turns a request into a stand-alone object
- 🔁 **Iterator**: Accesses elements sequentially without exposing underlying representation
- 🧭 **Mediator**: Reduces dependencies between objects by centralizing external communications
- 👀 **Observer**: Defines a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about events
- 🧠 **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable
- 🧬 **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, deferring some steps to subclasses
