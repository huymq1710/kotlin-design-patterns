![kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/images/kotlin-logo.png)

This repository contains implementations of classic design patterns in Kotlin, showcasing modern and idiomatic approaches to these time-tested software engineering solutions.

## 📚 Pattern Catalogs

The repository is organized into three main categories:

## 1️⃣ Creational Patterns 🏗️

| Pattern                | Description                                         | Complexity | Popularity |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|:----------:|:----------:|
| 🏭 Factory Method       | Creates objects without specifying exact class      | ⭐⭐         | ⭐⭐⭐         |
| 🧪 Abstract Factory     | Creates families of related objects                 | ⭐          | ⭐⭐⭐         |
| 🧱 Builder              | Constructs complex objects step by step             | ⭐⭐         | ⭐⭐⭐         |
| 🧬 Prototype            | Creates new objects by copying existing ones        | ⭐          | ⭐⭐          |
