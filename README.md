# Design Patterns Implemented in Kotlin

![kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/images/kotlin-logo.png)

This repository contains implementations of classic design patterns in Kotlin, showcasing modern and idiomatic approaches to these time-tested software engineering solutions.

## Pattern Catalogs

The repository is organized into three main categories:

### 1) Creational Patterns

These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms that enhance flexibility and promote code reuse by controlling the object creation process.

- **Factory Method**: Creates objects without specifying the exact class to create
- **Abstract Factory**: Creates families of related objects
- **Builder**: Constructs complex objects step by step
- **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying existing ones
- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance

### 2) Structural Patterns

These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping them flexible and efficient.

- **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together
- **Bridge**: Separates abstraction from implementation
- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures
- **Decorator**: Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem
- **Flyweight**: Minimizes memory usage by sharing common parts of state
- **Proxy**: Provides a surrogate for another object

### 3) Behavioral Patterns

These patterns focus on communication between objects, how they operate together, and the delegation of responsibilities.

- **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes requests along a chain of handlers
- **Command**: Turns a request into a stand-alone object
- **Iterator**: Accesses elements sequentially without exposing underlying representation
- **Mediator**: Reduces dependencies between objects by centralizing external communications
- **Observer**: Defines a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about events
- **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable
- **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, deferring some steps to subclasses

## Usage

Each pattern includes a standalone example with a main function that demonstrates the pattern in action. Navigate to the specific pattern directory to see implementation details and run examples.
