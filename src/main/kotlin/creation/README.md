# Creational Design Patterns

> Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.



![Factory Method](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/factory-method-mini.png)**Factory Method**

Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.



![Abstract Factory](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/abstract-factory-mini.png)**Abstract Factory**

Lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.



![Builder](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/builder-mini.png)**Builder**

Lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.



![Prototype](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/prototype-mini.png)**Prototype**

Lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.



![Singleton](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/singleton-mini.png)**Singleton**

Lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
