# Structural Design Patterns

> Structural design patterns explain how to assemble (sắp xếp/gom nhóm) objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

![Adapter](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/adapter-mini.png)**Adapter**

Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

![Bridge](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/bridge-mini.png)**Bridge**

Lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.

![Composite](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/composite-mini.png)**Composite**

Lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

![Decorator](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/decorator-mini.png)**Decorator**

Lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

![Facade](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/facade-mini.png)**Facade**

Provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

![Flyweight](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/flyweight-mini.png)**Flyweight**

Lets you fit more objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object.

![Proxy](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/proxy-mini.png)**Proxy**

Lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.
